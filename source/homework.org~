- Assembly of your torch should take around an hour.
- First ensure you have all the correct parts for the housing.

- Firstly line up the 3 pieces so that they all have the extra hole pointing the same direction.
- Take the acrylic piece with the square hole in the top.
- Lay it flat on a workbench exactly as shown below and then use a countersink cutter to create countersinks where the 3mm holes are in each corner.
- Keep testing your countersinks using the 3mm machine screws, to ensure you have countersinks deep enough that the head of the screw is flush to the acrylic.

- Now place your finished PCB onto the acrylic base, *make sure the extra hole is facing the correct way.* Then place the middle piece of acrylic on top of that, *ensuring the extra hole is pointing in the same direction.*

- Make sure the bottom (negative) wire is coiled on the bottom of the acrylic and the top (positive) wire is out of the way.
- Now place the battery on the wire with the *positive* facing up.

- Bend the positive wire down onto the battery and place the top acrylic plate on top.
- *Make sure the extra hole is facing the same direction and that the countersinks are on top.*

- Push the screws throuh the top and screw them directly into the bottom plate.
- *Please note: the bottom plate holes are slightly smaller than the rest, this is to allow the screws to self tap into it. There is no need to drill the holes bigger.*

- Test your torch.

- Once you have completed your board, take it to your teacher to show them it working.
- Take pictures of your torch from three different angles, including at least one where the LED lights up.
- You will be assessed on the quality of your build.
