- The LED is a very efficient component in converting electrical energy to light energy. 
- In the past we used incandescent bulb and then florescent tubes/bulbs to produce light. Do some research into each bulb, find out the circuit symbol for each, give a brief description on how they work and find out how much energy each bulb used to light a standard room.

- Complete the following table of resistor colour codes:


    |First|Second|Third|Tolerance | Value|
    |Red| Red| Orange| Gold|   |
    |Orange| Yellow| Red| Silver|  |
    |Violet| Grey| Yellow| Gold|  |
    |Brown| Black| Black| Gold|  |
    |Red| Green| Brown| Gold|  |
    |Yellow| Red |Red |Gold|  |  


- Calculate the voltage for following:

a. A circuit which has the current (I) of 0.02A with the resistance of 200Ω

b. A circuit which has the current (I) of 40mA with the resistance of 1kΩ
