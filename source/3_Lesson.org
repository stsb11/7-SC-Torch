- =Light Emitting Diodes= are a fairly modern invention. The first practical LED componenets were only developed in 1962, unlike the light bulb which has been around since the late 1800s.
- LEDs emit light when a voltage is applied across them. They last a long time, use very little energy and are vey cheap to manufacture. This makes them superior to light bulbs in many applications.
- Despite how much LEDs are used, new types are still being developed.
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
On October 7, 2014, the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded to Isamu Akasaki, Hiroshi Amano and Shuji Nakamura for "the invention of efficient blue light-emitting diodes which has enabled bright and energy-saving white light sources" or, less formally, LED lamps.

- Look at the diagram of the LED below
[[file:img/LED-diagram.png]]
- LEDs can only be placed in a circuit one way round. (You'll learn why in a bit).
- They have one leg that is the cathode and another that is the anode.
- There are several ways to recognise which side of the LED is which.
| Anode                | Cathode               |
|----------------------+-----------------------|
| positive(+)          | negative(-)           |
| rounded edge         | flat edge             |
| longest leg          | shortest leg          |
| small triangle(post) | large triangle(anvil) |
- Compare this list to the diagram above, so you know what the parts are.

- Find an LED and take a photo of it using your phone or tablet (or your teacher's). Make sure you get a close up.
- Use a graphics package to try and label the photo, like the diagram above.

- LEDs contain two different types of material, one that carries positive charges called /=holes=/ and one that carries negative chatges - the electrons we met in the last lesson.
- The holes try to flow from the anode towards the cathode.
- The electrons try to flow from the cathode to the anode.
- This flow of charges means that current is flowing through the LED.
- If an electron and a hole meet each other, they produce a particle of light.

- The animation should show you why LEDs can only be used one way around.
- Try hitting the /=polarity=/ button to reverse the way the LED is connected.
- You should see that the charges are stuck at either end, and therefore no current is flowing, and no light is emitted.

- The symbol for an LED is shown below.
[[file:img/LED_symbol.png]]
- In your own words, and using screenshots of the animation above, try and explain why the symbol is drawn in this way.
- Be sure to include the following points:
  - What is meant by anode and cathode
  - Why there are two arrows pointing away from the LED
  - Why the symbol looks like an /arrow/ with a vertical bar infront of it.
- To get your Gold badge you must provide a clear explanation and use correct spelling and grammar.

- You've seen that LEDs and resistors both allow charges to flow through them. You also know that resistors limit the current that flows through them.
- LEDs are different though, they have an all or nothing approach to electric current. In one direction _no_ current can flow, while in the other direction they'll more or less allow all the current that can be provided by the power supply to flow through them.
- This can be a problem. At high currents there are lots of collisions going on inside the LED, and this produces a lot of heat. This can cause the LED to =burnout= or even =explode=

- To protect our LEDs we always put them in series with a resistor, to ensure we are limiting the current flowing through them.

- *Note* - /You should complete the Lesson on Circuit Design before coming back to try this badge/
- Use Circuit Wizard to create a circuit containing an LED and a 9V power supply.
- Ensure that explosions are turned on and run the simulation
- Now add a resistor to the circuit and see what happens.
- Use screenshots of your simulation to explain why we need resistors in our LED circuits.
