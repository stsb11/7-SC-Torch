** Introduction

:END:
- If you excel at Systems & Control, you might find yourself finishing your LED Torch well before your peers.
- The following Extension activity will allow you to learn some new engineering skills and to practice your modelling skills.
- There will be no badges awarded for this activity. The rewards is the work itself.
** Learn It

- For this task, you're going to learn how to accurately measure the dimensions of the LED torch housing.
- Once you have the dimensions, you can then have a go at creating the parts in SolidWorks and making the housing as an assembly.

- If we need to measure the width of a part, there are several tools we could use.
- The simplest tool would be a ruler
[[file:https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/86/Steel_ruler_closeup.jpg]]
- The problem with a ruler, is it's accuracy.
- You could measure an object and know it was between 52mm and 53mm in length, but your best guess could only be 52.5mm
- To be able to measure lengths smaller than a millimeter, we need to use another device.

- These are Vernier Callipers

- Vernier Callipers allow us to measure lengths to the nearest 0.1mm (or sometimes even smaller).
- They use a scale called a Vernier Scale. Ask your teacher for a pair of Vernier Callipers, so you can learn how to use them.

- Here is an animation showing how to use the Vernier Scale.

- The basic concept is to match up the marks on the two scales, to determine the number of 0.1mm increments to add to your initial reading.
- Let's have a go at doing this with the LED Torch housing.
- Grab one of the parts for the LED torch
-Adjust the Vernier Callipers so that the jaws fit tightly around the part, as shown below.

3. The scale is fairly simple to read - have a look at this close up.
[[file:img/Scale.jpg]]
- Hopefully you can see in the picture above, that the part is greater than 3cm in length.
- If you look to where the first graduation of the _bottom_ scale meets the _top_ scale, you'll be able to see that we can more accurately describe the part as being 3.4cm in length.
[[file:img/Scale2.png]]
- Now we look across at the bottom scale, and see which of the graduations most closely lines up with the upper scale's graduations
[[file:img/Scale3.png]]
- Here we can see that the ninth graduation is the one that matches, so that makes the dimension 3.49cm, or 34.9mm

- If you look at the animation below, you can see the whole process of measuring using Vernier Calipers

- We can also use the Vernier Callipers to measure the size of holes in the part.
- Look at the image below, showing how to measure the square hole in the top of the drawer alarm.

- On paper, sketch rough diagrams of all the parts for the LED torch housing.
- Now use Vernier Callipers to measure all the dimensions of the parts. (The small holes have a 3mm diameter)
** Design It

:END:
- You've used SolidWorks before, so this shouldn't be too difficult for you.
- Using SolidWorks, create sketches of all the parts.
- Extrude each part by 3mm
- Create an assembly of the four parts.
